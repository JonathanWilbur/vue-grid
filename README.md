# Vue Grid

This repository is abandoned. It was originally sourced from
[this repository](https://github.com/jbaysolutions/vue-grid-layout),
with the intent of improving upon its AWFUL code. This was my attempt at
implementing a draggable, droppable, resizable grid based on Vue, but using
TypeScript for building. I am just keeping this here in case somebody wants
it for whatever reason. It does not work quite right. If you can fix it,
good for you.

I have since moved on to using Angular. That is my MV-whatever framework of choice.
